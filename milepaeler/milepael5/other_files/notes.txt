1. read csv without inferSchema
2. then I read it with inferSchema, but notice some datatypes doesnt match
3. I notice that something is wrong with following columns:
	- world_rank: String - this is OK, since it sometimes contains values such as "100-150"
	- international: included the "-" where value should be "null"
		> same with income, total_score, and num_students
	- international_students included the "%"
4. I opened libreoffice and used the find&replace feature to fix these issues
	- Kunne ha løst dette med .option("mode", "DROPMALFORMED")
5. I assigned universityDf again, and uses printSchema to make sure it was correct, and sure it was!
6. I tested a simple aggregation on it, and sorted by number of students in descending order
--
7. Wrote base file as parquet
8. Now I want to write my first aggregation
9. Wrote my first aggregation (avgScoreByYear) and wrote it to csv

10. Finished components for university by female/male ratio
11. Now ready to start on graph database

12. Made parquet from REGIME_2021.csv
13. About to make parquet from regime_list.csv, but notice that dates are string in schema
	1. I need to replace values such as m/d/yyyy with mm-dd-yyyy and save as CSV
	2. I need to use .option("timestampFormat", "mm-dd-yyyy")
	- Jeg gav opp, dette var for vanskelig
	- Tankegangen min var å legge på 0-er foran tall med lengde på 1 i den date-arrayen

14. Make parquet from leader_6_21.csv
	> Notice some inaccuracies in the csv file, will solve this by removing the last columns
	> Done

16. Make parquet from election_6_21.csv
	> Notice that elec_day is set to string by inferSchema, replacing spaces with null
	> tried using .option("treatEmptyValuesAsNull", "true") but obviously didn't work
	> Done

17. Now ready to make aggregations for Regime dataset
	- Going to make Regyme Type Development (Government development) Component
18. Loads REGIME_2021 parquet
	- Retrieved data, but not in the right format
	- Tried again, this time by having a column for each government type
